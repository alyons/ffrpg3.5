# Final Fantasy RPG 3.5

A modification of the FFRPG 3rd System

Theme: [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)

## To Do:
- [ ] Updated website to be easier to read
  - Make a modern version of the website
- [ ] Updated language to make things clearer when playing
  - Update terminology used with `Learned` skills, as this trips up players
- [ ] Job Reworks
  - Give every job a reaction
  - Give every job a support ability
    - Inate Magic Atk Up for Black Mages
    - Inate Teleport for Time Mages
    - Inate Ignore Height for Dragoons
  - Make sure jobes get more skills as they level (e.g. Monk gets 11~ abilities where Black Mage gets 34)
  - Multi-jobing
    - Do we only allow for a single reaction ability and support ability to be utilized?
    - Do we set a primary/secondary or let it be whatever goes?
    - Do we limit how many jobs one can take?
    - Do we limit which jobs can cross job?
    - Will there be abilities which are job locked, weapon locked, etc?
    - Advanced Jobs based on having levels in multiple classes with certain level caps and restrictions (One Advanced Job is active)
- [ ] Magic Update
  - Healing Magic formula nerf(?) should not have the same stat damaging magic
  - Check Magic formulas for consistency, for mana curve, and for upgrade
  - Validate Group targeting for magic
  - Different effects to Elemental Magic(?)
    - Thunder -> Stun
    - Blizzard -> Slow
    - Fire -> Bigger AoE
    - Aero -> Bonus Dmg to Enemies with Float or who are flying
    - Reflect should be instant cast (at least for Time Mage)
    - White Magic does the same damage as Black Magic
  - Charge Time to Spells
- [ ] Skill Rework
  - Too many points and too confusing to put points in right now
  - Way too many skills for Lore, Language, and Crafting
- [ ] Other Changes
  - Hit Die, Magic Die, & Resting
    - Lower 3 rests consume hit die
    - Higher 3 rests restore hit die
    - Only spend X hit die based on amount of rest
  - Make the Battle Grid not an optional rule (i.e. work all parts of it into the book)
- [ ] Monster Builder
- [ ] Character Builder
- [ ] Monster Compendium
