# How to Play
## Determining Chance

- Some things are up to chance.
- Roll dice and add certain values to determine if successful
- DC = difficulty of achieving the goal

| Task Difficulty | Difficulty Class |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Trivial         | 5                |
| Easy            | 10               |
| Moderate        | 15               |
| Taxing          | 20               |
| Extraordinary   | 25               |
| Nigh Impossible | 30               |
| Mythical        | 35               |

True Success: Result >= DC + 10
Mixed Success: Result >= DC
Flounder: Result >= DC - 10
Flubbed: Result < DC - 10

## Proficiency

| Proficiency Tier | Die   |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Untrained*       | 1d12  |
| Novice           | 1d20  |
| Journeyman       | 1d20+ |
| Inspector        | 2d10  |
| Expert           | 2d10+ |
| Master           | 2d12  |
| Legendary        | 2d12+ |

Note*: Some skills cannot be used as untrained.

Note+: With Advantage

### Advantage and Disadvantage
- Amounts of advantage and disadvantage would add die and given the amount of change, you would drop the lowest or the highest
	- If a player has advantage, they add one die to the pool and drop the lowest
	- If a player has 1 advantage, and 2 disadvantage, they would end up with 1 disadvantage total, and roll an extra die and drop the lowest
	- I liked your idea of capping it at 3 die in any situation.
