title: "Magic"

Magic is a fundamental and natural part of the world, manifest in all
things animate and inanimate. The flow of magical energy, or mana,
in the world as a whole is essential to its well-being; only so long as
the power of the elements is unchecked can the wind continue to
blow, the earth continue to be fertile, the cycle of life and death go
on. All of the world's inhabitants, whether conscious of it or not,
have some small part of this force inside them; with training, it can
be turned into a weapon more powerful than mere blade or brawn,
more devastating than all but the farthest-reaching technologies.  
Most worlds contain at least some degree of ‘background magic’
– enough mana to sustain life on the world itself, but a far cry from
the sheer amount of free energy needed to fuel true spellcasting.
The existence of Mages depends heavily on the presence of objects
that reinforce and amplify this weak level of natural magic to the
point where it can be actively shaped.

### Magicite
Certain kinds of naturally-occurring crystals have been found to be
curiously sympathetic to the flow of mana, able to focus, store and
even amplify natural elemental forces. Such crystals are known as
magicite, and can vary widely in both size and power. At its smallest,
magicite can be little more than a microscopic powder trapped within
larger rock formations, creating unusual phenomena through pentup
mana. A stone charged with a modest amount of Fire energy, for
instance, would feel unusually warm to the touch, though its
sorcerous uses are next to nil. Conversely, genuinely titanic magicite
formations such as the legendary Four Crystals are magical
reservoirs without peer, capable of raising and destroying nations
with equal ease.  
Magicite can be used for any number of purposes, ranging from
powering machinery to enriching soil. Most magically-empowered
equipment is constructed by binding the rush of energy freed by the
destruction of magicite fragments into the item during the creation
process; more powerful arms and armor may be made of pure
magicite crystals, and are capable of absorbing and channeling
significant amounts of magical power.

### Battle Items
Almost all creatures have some amount of magicite in their bodies,
allowing them to channel mana for their own uses. Upon death, part
of the magical energy that has passed through the creature may
linger in its magicite; parts of the creature that have particularly
high concentrations of magicite can even be harvested to make a
Battle Item. Such ‘frozen’ magic is typically more common in the
remains of creatures of arcane origin, such as Bombs; virtually any
fragment of their bodies can be used to unleash a small spark of
offensive spellcasting in the right hands.

### Ecologies of Magic
Even as it sustains life, magic in turn creates its own ecology,
ranging in scale from animal-like nature spirits to the primitive
elementals, creatures 'birthed' by large masses of elemental energy
converging on a single location. At the tip of the proverbial totem
pole are the Summons, known by a million and one names
throughout the universe; such creatures typically dwell on planes of
pure power connected to a world by only the most tenuous of links,
drawn into material existence by the persuasive talents of Caller and
Summoner alike.  
The environment, too, interacts with raw flows of magic,
resonating where the elements are most sympathetic. The heat of a
volcano, for instance, can tie together many streams of Fire
Elemental energy, creating a reservoir of mana favorable to arcane
creatures and spellcasters alike. Similarly, a lightning strike during a
ferocious thunderstorm attracts Lightning Elemental energy; a
torrential rainfall leads to the accumulation of Water Elemental
power. For those who rely on the might of the elements, careful
consideration of one’s surroundings is an important factor in
effectively shaping these energies.

### Spellcasters
Active wielders of magical power vary wildly in shape and scope.
With sufficient training and physical discipline, warriors can channel
elemental flows into their techniques; to them, this force is known as
chi and accounts for much of their power in battle. However, such
applications are rigid, depending as much on the warrior’s physical
prowess as on their awareness of the magical basis underlying
them. A true Mage can actively twist and focus raw flows of magic
into physical, visible forms; dark mists, freezing gales, howling
storms, and scorching waves of fire.  
The spellcasting procedure itself depends on the power and
experience of the mage in question. Beginners rely heavily on subvocalized
incantations to focus the power necessary to unleash their
Spell of choice; more advanced practitioners can invoke magic with
nothing more than a simple hand-gesture. Once prepared, all Spells
can be activated by a spoken word – usually the spell's name , such
as 'Cura!' – or a more grandiose command, such as "Star fire,
awaken and deliver your judgment! Firaga!” However, it should be
noted that such pronouncements are usually delivered more for
intimidation value than actual practicality; in both cases, the results
are the same.  
Casting magic also has a visual aspect, as mana drawn by casters
from the immediate environment solidifies into motes of light just
before entering the caster's body. How noticeable this is depends on
both the power of the caster and the amount of mana required by
the Spell; particularly adept magicians can disguise these 'mana
signatures' to make even high-intensity spellcasting effectively
invisible.

### The Elements of Magic
The classification of magic has occupied scholars for centuries. Even
to this day, the finer details of magical taxonomy can be fuel for
considerable debate. Certain aspects, however, are considered to be
universally agreed on. Among them is the fact that mana is the basic
building-block of magic; though further diversified and refined, raw
mana can be used to drive a wide variety of helpful and harmful
effects. From here, all magic can be broadly broken up into three
major groups of forces – Elemental, Cosmic and Life.  
The Elemental forces are sometimes also called ‘natural forces’,
deriving that designation from the fact that they are inextricably tied
to natural phenomena. The most common of these involve the four
basic elements – Earth, Fire, Wind and Water – which in turn
combine to form the distinctive ‘para-elements’ of Lightning and Ice.
To these are added Bio, Holy and Shadow. The inclusion of the latter
two is problematic for those who see them as supernatural rather
than mundane forces. As a result, in some quarters the latter three
are not considered elements at all, and simply excised from the
reckoning. The collective grouping of these nine – Earth, Fire, Air,
Water, Lightning, Ice, Bio, Holy and Shadow – is referred to as the
Combat Elements; spells focusing their power are intended for harm
and destruction more often than not.  
Outside the domain of the elements is the force of Cosmos; its
components are Time and Gravity, the distortion of which forms the
basis of the Time Mage’s curious powers. In many cases, the end
result is a roundabout way of accomplishing what elemental magic
will easily do in skilled hands; rather than launch a fireball, a Time
Mage will twist the forces of Time and pluck a comet shower from
distant antiquity just long enough to bombard their opponents into
submission.  
The final component of the magical spectrum is another
overarching force, Life, given power by the cycle of birth and death
and the migration of souls. Though not inherently a magical thing, its
interactions with raw magic have allowed White Mages and other
practitioners of healing to use it in the same fashion as its wilder
elemental counterparts. As a result, its inclusion remains a point of
contention.

## Spell Classifications
For the sake of clarifying effects and offering an organizational
thread to tie various Spells together, each Spell belongs to a
distinctive category.

### Elemental Magic
Elemental Magic is a term used to describe any Spell that deals
damage associated with one of the nine Combat Elements.

### Arcane Magic
Any Spell that directly deals damage to an opponent but is not
affiliated with a Combat Elements belongs to the category of Arcane
Magic. Arcane Magic can deal either Physical or Magical damage;
which of the two is noted in the 'Type' field.

### Recovery Magic
Recovery Magic describes any Spell that recovers HP or MP to a
target – usually the caster, or one of the caster's allies – or removes
negative Status Conditions. Recovery Magic can have unexpected
effects on Undead monsters – and combatants afflicted with the
Status Condition Zombie.

### Status Magic
Any Spell that inflicts one or more Status Conditions as a result of its
casting, beneficial or otherwise, is known as Status Magic. For the
sake of calculating Immunities, these Spells are divided into seven
categories – Mystify, Toxin, Seal, Time, Transform, Fatal, and Weak –
based on the Status Conditions they inflict. There are also two
positive Status Categories, Barrier and Strengthen.

### Support Magic
Support Magic covers Spells that do not have a direct effect on
either the caster, the caster’s allies, or their opponents. The Spell
Sight, which allows a White Mage to get an overview of an area, is a
prime example of this kind of magic.

### Spellblade Magic
Spellblade Magic is the specialized category of magic used by Magic
Knights and their ilk. Rather than directly affecting opponents, such
Spells instead use the caster’s weapon as a conduit.

## Spell List

#### Format
The Spell listings over the remainder of the Chapter are set out as
follows:  
The first thing listed is the Spell's casting name. Due to differences
in translation between Final Fantasy games, players may know some
of these by alternate names – Blizzara, for instance, is occasionally
called Ice 2. To avoid creating confusion, only one name is given for
each Spell.  
The MP Cost is given to the right of the spell’s name, and lists the
number of Magic Points required to cast the Spell. Casting cost is
subtracted from the Mage's current MP when the Spell is cast.
Target shows which combatants the Spell affects.  
Type indicates which Spell Category that particular Spell falls
under, used for the purposes of calculating Immunities.  
The R or NR indicate whether a Spell is affected by the Status
Condition Reflect (R) or not (NR).  
Prerequisite lists which other Spells the Mage must have learned
in order to be able to obtain this particular Spell, where applicable.

However, the Escape will fail if the caster’s destination is inside a
solid structure or occupied by another person or object; in this case,

successful casting of Escape has effects equal to a successful
Escape Action.

favorable result of the two rolls. After this has been done, Reset’s
effects expire. The effects also expire if no reroll is made before the
end of combat, or if the combatant is targeted by Dispel or
Temporal Shirt. If cast on an opponent, the caster may choose which
roll to ‘reset’. Multiple castings of Reset do not increase the number
of rerolls available; the Spell will only have an effect if the target is
not already eligible for a reroll.
Teleport 10 MP
Target: Party Type: Support NR
The air ripples, beginning to glow as the party dematerializes,
reappearing a distance away just seconds later. Targets affected by
Teleport immediately move (MAG x 5) meters in a direction of the
caster’s choosing, passing through any solid objects – such as walls
– without ill effects. However, the Teleport will fail if the caster’s

without ill effects. However, the Exit will fail if the caster’s destination
is inside a solid structure or occupied by another person or object;
in this case, MP and time are still spent as normal. If cast in a

#### Level 7
WarP 100 MP
Target: Party Type: Support NR
Energy ripples around the caster and their allies as they wink out of
existence, reappearing an instant later many miles away. Warp must
be cast twice in order to be effective; the first time it is cast, an
arcane circle of energy forms around the caster, marking the
immediate area before fading away – this is the Time Mage’s Home
Point, whose location should be noted at the time the Spell is cast.
The second time Warp is cast, the caster – and all allies in the
immediate area – are teleported back to the Home Point, regardless
of how much distance separates their current location with the
Home Point. If this effect is used in combat, it has effects equal to a
successful Escape Action for all Party members. Once the Party
arrives back at the Home Point, the arcane circle winks out of
existence; to set a new Home Point, Warp must be cast again.
Prerequisite: Exit
QUICKEN 103 MP
Target: Single Type: Support NR
The target blurs as it slides sideways in time, seeing the battlefield
frozen in its tracks for a brief moment. Quicken’s target may make
an Action as soon as the Spell is cast, even if they have already used
their allotment of Actions for the Round or are currently resolving an
Action with a Charge Time. Taking this Action will not count towards
their limit of Actions for the Round; if the chosen Action has a
Charge Time, resolve it immediately and subtract the Charge Time
from the combatant’s current Initiative count.
RETURN 85 MP
Target: Party Type: Support NR
The battlefield seems to fold up as time is compressed and enclosed
in a glowing globe that continually replays captured moments on its
rippling surface. Until the end of combat, the caster and all allies on
the battlefield may each re-roll any one die roll they make, keeping

Target: Self Type: Support NR
A translucent clock encases the caster, creating a pocket of localized
time for a few precious seconds before shattering. Quick allows the
caster to make two Actions as soon as the Spell is cast; if the Actions
have a Charge Time, it is ignored. In addition, casting Quick a second
time while under the influence of Quick brings the caster back into
normal time, canceling the effects of both Spells. After the second
Action has been taken, the caster’s Initiative drops to 0, regardless
of whether or not the caster would normally be eligible to make
additional Actions.

INTUITIVE MAGIC
In Final Fantasy, most magic is heavily regimented, divided into set
groups of Spells with explicit effects that never change. This does
not mean that there is no room for creativity, however – on the
contrary, by drawing on their experience, veteran casters can create
all manner of cantrips, illusions, and other sorcerous miscellanea. In
the FFRPG, such magic is known as Intuitive Magic.
Basic Rules
Intuitive Magic is subject to several important restrictions. These
are:
No Intuitive effect can directly inflict or recover damage and Status
Conditions, or mimic the mechanical effects of an existing Spell. This
does not mean the effect's ultimate outcome must always be
harmless; using Intuitive magic to startle a soldier and send him
falling over a parapet will still result in damage, albeit indirectly.
A spellcaster can only create Intuitive magic in line with the Spells
he or she would normally be able to cast. A Black Mage, for instance,
would not be able to create a blast of air to knock a treasure chest
from a high pedestal, nor would a White Mage be able to create a
fiery explosion in mid-air. To make this simpler for both the players
and the GM, all Jobs with the ability to use Intuitive Magic or
comparative powers have a list of keywords in Chapter 4. In order to
be cast, the desired effect must be in line with one or more of these
keywords.
Spells cast through Intuitive magic are still Spells. If the character
is unable to cast Spells as a result of Status Conditions or other
extraordinary circumstances, Intuitive magic is similarly off-limits.
Intuitive Magic cannot be used more than once per Scene.
Creating a new magic effect is often an involved process, and
requires a brief 'cooldown' period between Spells.
Creating an Intuitive Effect
Because Intuitive effects are open-ended in nature, the rules to
create them are relatively simple – most of the 'heavy lifting'
involved in their creation relies on GM and player judgment.
DESCRIBE THE EFFECT
Whenever a player wishes to create an Intuitive effect, they must
begin by explaining what exactly they want to achieve. Legitimate
examples might include things like “Reshape the columns into a
stairway leading to the next level,” “Create a bridge from the
surrounding plants and creepers that will carry the party across the
chasm,” “Transfer enough mana to the Skystone to get the airship
off the ground,” or “Create a spectacular bang!” Before approving
the effect, the GM should make sure that what the player is trying to
achieve can't be readily done with an existing Spell and that the
effect is in line with the keywords given for the player's Job. Effects
that do not fall into any particular magical domain – as with the last
two examples given above – do not have to conform to a specific
keyword.
DETERMINE THE MP COST
The next step is to assign an MP cost to the effect. This will be
determined by how large an object or area it affects when cast – the
larger the scale, the higher the MP cost. While an effect's MP cost is
entirely left to the GM's discretion, the table below gives appropriate
ballpark figures for various size grades.
Table 8-2: Sample Intuitive MP Costs
SIZE OF ITEM OR AREA AFFECTED MP COST
Small rock 2
Average-sized rock 8
Child, Moogle, Tarutaru 15
Human 30
Ogre, Gigas 50
Small house 80
Large house 100
Skyscraper 200
City block 400
DETERMINE THE MODIFIER
Once the effect's cost has been established, the next thing on the list
is its difficulty – or to be precise, the Conditional Modifer imposed on
the player's M. Accuracy when rolling to see whether the effect
succeeds. This is determined by its complexity, or overall
sophistication. The more elaborate the intended effect, the lower the
ultimate CoS will be. Again, while this is left to the GM's discretion, a
number of sample modifiers have been given below.
Table 8-3: Sample Intuitive Modifiers
COMPLEXITY MODIFIER
Creating a bright flash -20
Creating a crude illusion -20
Using telekinesis to move an object -40
Creating a modest illusion -60
-80
Creating a sophisticated illusion -100
-120
-140
Reshaping the immediate environment -160
MAKING THE ROLL
To complete the effect, the caster must make a Task Check against
their Magic Accuracy, subtracting the modifier assigned for the
effect's complexity. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may
also assign additional modifiers; some examples are given below. If
the roll succeeds, the player achieves the desired effect; if the roll
fails, the Magic Points have been wasted.
CONDITIONAL MODIFIERS
Effect's scale larger than a human: -20
Effect's scale larger than small house: -40
Elaborate, hour-long rituals performed beforehand: +20
Working against weak enchantments: 0
Working against competent enchantments: -20
Working against elaborate enchantments: -40
Working against masterful enchantments: -80
CASTING CIRCLES
In magic, as in all other things, two heads are often better than one.
Intuitive Magic can benefit from the Groupwork rules from Chapter 5,
provided that all other participants have the appropriate Intuitive
Magic ability.
Sample Intuitive Effects
Medeo 15 mp
Effect: A classic example of stage magic. Medeo mimics the effects
of the Time Spell Meteor, summoning an asteroid fragment to crash
into the target with a devastating explosion. Unlike its 'genuine'
counterpart, Medeo is all sound and fury, doing no damage; the
pyrotechnics produced, however, are indistinguishable from the real
thing. Medeo is cast at a CoS of (M. ACC - 60).
