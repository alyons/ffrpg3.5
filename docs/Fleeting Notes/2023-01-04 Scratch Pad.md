## Goals for Shards of the Crystal Braves
- Evoke the feeling of a Final Fantasy Game
	- Flavor of Classes/Jobs

- How will this be different
	- Look at avoiding EXP and simply use Milestones via Quests
- What else can we do to make this as obvious as possible
	- Player's Handbook
	- Lore Keeper's Handbook
	- Beastiary
	- Tale of the Warriors of Light (Module based on Final Fantasy I)
