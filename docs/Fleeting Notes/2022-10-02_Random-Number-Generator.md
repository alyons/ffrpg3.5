## Context and Problem Statement
As part of a table top roleplaying game, we want to have a way to describe variance within gameplay mechanics. This will be used in conjuction with player choices in the actions within the moment as well as choices the player has made in creating their character.

## Decision Drivers
1. We need a system that is simple to use. _Simple is not easy._
2. We need a system that encourages player choice.

## Considered Options
### d20
The actor rolls a d20 and adds a specific number appropriate to the test being applied. If the value meets or beats the set difficulty value, the check is successful.  
In certain tests, rolling a 1 on the d20 counts as a failure and rolling a 20 on the d20 counts as a success.  

Difficulty Class
| Difficulty | Average Value |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Trivial    |               |
| Easy       |               |
|            |               |

#### Pros
- Simple system to use
#### Cons
- Just like D&D
- The status numbers have be adjusted to make decision matter.
#### Others
