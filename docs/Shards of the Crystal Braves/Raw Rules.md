### Advantage and Disadvantage
- Amounts of advantage and disadvantage would add die and given the amount of change, you would drop the lowest or the highest
	- If a player has advantage, they add one die to the pool and drop the lowest
	- If a player has 1 advantage, and 2 disadvantage, they would end up with 1 disadvantage total, and roll an extra die and drop the lowest
	- I liked your idea of capping it at 3 die in any situation.

### Class Features
- Expertise would add an additional rank, outside of the 5 from leveling up
- Jack of All Trades
	- At a low level, any skill attempted is always attempted as though you are at least a Novice
	- At a mid level, any skill attempted is always attempted as though you are at least an Apprentice
	- At a high level, and perhaps only a certain Bardic College, any skill attempted is always attempted as though you are at least a Journeyman

| Master           | 4d4  | 3/2x       | 13-16          | 11.3281% |
| Legendary        | 2d10 | 3/2x       | 17-20          | 10%      |
| Demi-God         | 5d4  | 2x         | 16-20          | 11.8164% |

### Notes
- The die are not finialize on this list, as these were my gut feelings when creating this idea.
- As the numbers change, imagine that your character is mastering new techniques which can yeild better outcomes, but are more risky to use.
- For critical ranges:
	- **3d6:** 15-18 => 9.2593%
	- **5d4:** 15-20 => 21.6797%
-  Untrained skills would be marked by a flag stating if an attempt can be made without proficiency.
	-  Athletics such as jumping would net you your half modifier
	-  Lockpicking would afford you no such bonus.

Clearly We don't want all of those skills, but some of those could be default proficiencies!

- Separate Weapon Skills out to something else
- Add Rods/Staves as they are more magical, or remove Cudgels b/c we aren't adding clubs
